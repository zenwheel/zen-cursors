# Zen Cursors Theme
A cursor theme based on icons from the macOS. Code and assets licensed under the MIT license.

Based off build process from numix-cursor-theme
https://github.com/numixproject/numix-cursor-theme.git combined with the mac-cursors svg files from https://github.com/daviddarnes/mac-cursors

### Building
To build the themes from source you'll need Inkscape and xcursorgen installed. Then run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenwheel/zen-cursors-theme.git
cd zen-cursors-theme/
./build.sh
```

The respective cursor icons are then generated and saved to both the `zen-cursors` or `zen-red-cursors` folders.
