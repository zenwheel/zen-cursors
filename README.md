# Zen Cursors Theme
A cursor theme based on icons from the macOS. Code and assets licensed under the MIT license.

### Building
To build the themes from source you'll need Inkscape and xcursorgen installed. Then run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenwheel/zen-cursors-theme.git
cd zen-cursors-theme/
./build.sh
```

The respective cursor icons are then generated and saved to both the `Numix-Cursor{-Light}` folders.
